### Overview
* How pricing and discount data are displayed in the portal.
* Invoicing customers and special pricing scenarios.
* Getting billing data and the schedule for receiving billing reports.

### The Basics of Pricing and Discounts

#### Cloud Portal Pricing

Prices in the Cloud Portal are displayed at list price. The customer never sees the partner’s discounted price.

#### CenturyLink Invoice to Partner

When you receive the invoice from CenturyLink, your contracted discount will be applied.

### Invoicing Customers and Special Pricing

#### Partner Invoice to Customer

As a partner, you are responsible for invoicing your customers. The subsequent slide describes how to get detailed billing data for your customers.

#### Special Pricing Scenarios

**Customer Discount**

You can extend a discount at the time of invoice. Communicate to your customer that prices displayed in the CenturyLink Cloud Portal are at list price; their invoice will reflect their discount.

**Rates Higher Than List**

If you want to charge a price higher than list price (because you are offering additional services), a manual process is used to reflect this in the portal.  Email noc@ctl.io to make this request.

### Getting Billing Data and Reports

**Method 1: Billing Report**

**How It Works:** CenturyLink will email a report with the previous month’s billing data in .CSV format to an email alias of your choice.  Use this data to invoice your customers.
**Timing:** Report is sent by the 2nd business day of the month.
**About The Report:** The report is broken out by account and prices displayed are at list price.
**Sample Billing Report:** See the attachment at the bottom of this article.

**Method 2: API Integration (Optional)**

**How It Works:** You can integrate with CenturyLink Cloud’s APIs to pull billing data automatically.
