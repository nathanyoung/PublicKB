<p>CenturyLink Cloud provides SPLA licensing as a means of delivering cost-effective, utility computing. Customers may apply Microsoft or Red Hat enterprise licenses to their Virtual Machines and are billed the corresponding amount as long as the machine is in a live
  state. Customers who archive their servers do not pay for licensing until the Virtual Machine is placed back into production- archiving servers is a great way to manage costs while retaining operational agility.&nbsp;You may have seen <a href="https://t3n.zendesk.com/entries/23228148-Using-Your-Windows-Licenses-in-the-Tier-3-Cloud"
 >this</a> article on using your Enterprise Agreement Licenses (as long as you have a valid Software Assurance policy) in the CenturyLink Cloud.</p>
<p>Recently, Microsoft amended its MSDN (Microsoft Developer Network) package license terms to enable use of said licenses in either their Azure cloud or on third party clouds- such as CenturyLink Cloud.</p>
<p>Please note that this right does not extend to either any server or desktop Operating System- they must, as with the EA "License Mobility" Program, be purchased through the cloud vendor. The following is an excerpt directly from Microsoft's announcement
  page for this program:</p>
<p>"This cloud use right applies to all software included in the MSDN subscription except Windows client and Windows Server. Windows client (Windows 7, Windows 8, etc.) is only licensed to run on local devices. MSDN subscribers can run Windows Server on
  Windows Azure Virtual Machines, but since this is not included as part of the cloud use rights, subscribers will be charged at the rate of Windows Server Virtual Machines. This cloud use right be available through Qualified MSDN Cloud Partners as well.</p>
<p>Starting June 1, 2013, any current MSDN subscriber who has activated their subscription may run most of the software licensed under MSDN on Windows Azure Virtual Machines, providing greater flexibility for developing and testing their applications.</p>
<p><strong>MSDN subscribers who have activated their subscription can run most MSDN software in VMs on Windows Azure and VMs on shared servers run by third parties that are Qualified MSDN Cloud Partners.</strong> The cloud use right is only to design, develop,
  test or demonstrate software. The cloud use right applies to Visual Studio and all other software included in the userâ€™s MSDN subscription, except Windows client and Windows Server. This use does not require a separate Remote Desktop Services (RDS)
  license to access the VM.</p>
<p><strong>Windows client (Windows 7, Windows 8, etc.) is not eligible to be run in any cloud environment so MSDN subscribers should continue using local devices, such as those with touch screens and local peripherals, to develop and test their applications on Windows for the highest fidelity experience.</strong>
  <br
  /><strong>MSDN subscribers can run Windows Server in VMs on Windows Azure and on shared servers run by Qualified MSDN Cloud Partners, but since Windows Server is not licensed as part of these MSDN cloud use rights, subscribers will be charged for this use at the established Windows Server VM rates. MSDN subscribers can use their Windows Azure MSDN benefit toward the cost of running these Windows Server VMs on Windows Azure.</strong>
