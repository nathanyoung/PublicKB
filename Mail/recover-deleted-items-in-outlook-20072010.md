</p>
<p>Make sure you have Outlook 2007 open. On the main menu click “Tools” and click the “Recover Deleted Items” option.</p>

<p>The Recovery window will open and display all emails that can be recovered. Click on the email(s) that you want to recover and click the “Recover Selected Items” button (it’s the second button in the top menu).</p>

<p>All emails that you have selected will be put back in the original folder that you deleted them from. So if you deleted the item straight from your Inbox, the email will be put back in your Inbox.</p>
