**Q: What is CenturyLink Cloud Status?**

A: It is a portal that allows users to gain insight into the health of the cloud platform, stay in tune with service incidents, and learn about upcoming maintenance.

**Q: What does this mean for users of the CenturyLink Cloud platform?**

A: This feature will provide a self-service mechanism for staying current on cloud system status, incident progress, and upcoming maintenance activities. After the release date, maintenance and outage emails will stop coming from communications@centurylinkcloud.com. All notifications will come from CenturyLink Cloud Notification at noc@ctl.io.

**Q: How do I get access to CenturyLink Cloud Status updates?**

A: You can get updates through CenturyLink Cloud Status in two ways:

1: Go to http://status.ctl.io/ at any time to see an overview of the present health of the cloud and information regarding scheduled maintenance. In the event of an outage, users can get real-time status updates here too.

2: Users will be automatically enrolled in an email notification program. You will receive an email alerting you of your enrollment. Information about planned maintenance and incidents will be sent out to the email addresses provided by users when they provision an account on the CenturyLink Cloud platform.

**Q: I don’t want to receive automated email updates. How do I opt out?**

A: Each alert email has a “Manage Subscription” link at the end. Following this link gives takes users to a portal that provides the ability to control the alerts they receive in the following ways:
* Include or exclude certain datacenters (e.g. WA1)
* Include or exclude certain services (e.g. Object Storage)
* Opt out of notifications for all services and datacenters
 
**To opt out of all notifications, users must manually uncheck all the boxes on the Manage Subscription page, and click the Save Subscription button at the end of the Components list.** 

_Please note:  there is an “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the Manage Subscription page. We do not presently advise users to select this option. At this point in time, unsubscribe elections will be immediately overwritten and you will resume receiving notifications the following day. We are actively working on fixing this bug._

**Q: This sounds great! Is there an API or Webhook available so that I can build my own tools around it?**

A: Presently, there are not. We are working on this, and have set a target to make this available later in the year.

**Q: How do I provide feedback and ideas on how to improve this service?**

A: We welcome your requests and feedback! Please see [How Do I Submit a Feature Request?](../Support/how-do-i-submit-a-feature-request.md) to learn how to best reach us with your input.
