##Overview

HD Console is available on Hadoop Clusters on CenturyLink Cloud. The console provides an overview of installed add-on services as well as host data within the cluster (memory, disk usage, IP, etc.). Additionally, links to hadoop resources (Cloudera Manager, Hue & Navigator) specific to the cluster are conveniently located on the menu bar.
