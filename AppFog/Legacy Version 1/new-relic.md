<p>If you have seen the New Relic website, it says we they are partnered with AppFog. That is no longer the case.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://newrelic.com/appfog">New Relic AppFog Page</a></li>
</ul>
<p>New Relic reporting will be available with AppFog v2, but is not currently offered in AppFog v1. Workarounds might be found <a href="http://newrelic.com/resources">here</a>.</p>
<p>We apologize for the confusion.</p>
