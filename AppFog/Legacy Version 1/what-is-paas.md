<p>PaaS or Platform-as-a-Service is one of the three central types of Cloud Computing models, and sits neatly in-between IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) and SaaS (Software-as-a-Service). PaaS offerings allow businesses to take advantage of the scalability, agility, cost, and performance benefits of the cloud but without the management and administration overhead of infrastructure or OS-level configuration.</p>
<p><strong>Common Characteristics of a PaaS</strong><br /> PaaS services generally have a core group of functionality and characteristics which differentiates them from other types of Cloud options. A few of these characteristics are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tools to manage application lifecycle.</strong> PaaS offerings traditionally allow developers easy deployment, change management, and scalability of their application. For example, Git is a common tool used for application lifecycle and development management. More on git <a href="http://university.appfog.com/git-basics-on-paas/">here</a>.<br /> </li>
<li><strong>A multi-tenant environment (usually).</strong> Many PaaS systems come with a reasonable price-point due to their efficiency in multi-tenant design. Its important to note that multi-tenancy does not lend itself to application insecurity; a properly configured PaaS service can wall off customer applications from each other effectively. It's worthwhile to note, however, that as of late, Private PaaS offerings are also coming to market with a single-tenant design. Private PaaS solutions can address the needs of many Government and Enterprise customers.<br /> </li>
<li><strong>A web-based user interface backed by CLIs.</strong> Deploying and maintaining applications on PaaS systems should be easy. Point and click app deployment can be expected, and users should be able to get started quickly. Strong PaaS systems also come with advanced CLI tools for savvy developers who prefer to work at the command line. A PaaS user should never have to SSH into an instance or manage LAMP stacks, firewall rules, or other components of a system. All PaaS management is conducted via these two means.<br /> </li>
<li><strong>Easy scalability and redundancy.</strong> A PaaS should allow for easy scalability, both horizontally (additional nodes) and vertically (more RAM &amp; Compute power per instance). This scalability should be achieved with a few clicks and no specific advanced configuration.<br /> </li>
<li><strong>Integration with add-on tools.</strong> Platform as a Service offerings should have built-in extensibility for added technologies. Dedicated Database support, monitoring, logging, message queuing, etc. should all be available for easy integration from a various selection of partners.<br /> </li>
<li><strong>Billing and usage integration. </strong>A PaaS should provide customers with easy insight into the resources being used, with various financial and performance metrics.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Benefits of PaaS for Businesses</strong><br /> Businesses of all sizes are realizing the benefits of PaaS as they begin integrating the services into their environments. These businesses are seeing the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low to no upfront investment</li>
<li>A minimization of operational costs</li>
<li>Zero infrastructure management - "<a href="http://blog.appfog.com/what-is-noops-anyhow/">NoOps</a>" </li>
<li>Easily integrate with other web services</li>
<li>Fast deployment (within minutes)</li>
<li>Simple and quick scalability</li>
<li>Allows companies to focus on their core competencies</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PaaS empowers Developers</strong><br /> Platform as a Service offerings are designed with developers in mind. PaaS allows developers to work independently on any type of application, while freeing them from the hurdles of licensing issues, infrastructure and budgetary allocation, and operational approval. PaaS often is the cornerstone of Shadow IT, which actually often drives the most innovation and technological advancement, especially in larger, slower-moving organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Things to consider when choosing a PaaS</strong><br /> With literally dozens of PaaS providers to choose from, how do you go about narrowing down the right one for you and your business? Here are a few thoughts to consider.</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for multiple frameworks and languages. Even if you currently are only developing in one language, a service with the flexibility of multiple languages and frameworks allows you to be able to grow with unexpected needs and technology shifts. Provider consolidation is always important, and the more needs your PaaS selection can fill, the better. As a note, in the PaaS world, you may often hear the term "polyglot". This simply means multiple-language support.<br /> </li>
<li>Multi-provider / multi-geography support. PaaS solutions which run on multiple providers and multiple geographies allow for redundancy and flexibility. If your application is spread across multiple providers and one has a failure, you still have the benefit of being online via the other(s). This support should be integrated into your PaaS of choice and achievable easily via a few clicks or API calls.<br /> </li>
<li>Open-Source solutions with no vendor lock-in. PaaS solutions which are designed on Open-Source tools, APIs, and deployment environments ensure for application portability. No PaaS provider is perfect, and having the ability to easily pick your application up and move it to a different provider if you so wish should be a simple process. Moving applications between your in-house environment, or your own dev environment on your laptop, and your PaaS provider, should not require code rewrites.<br /> </li>
<li>Extensibility via a tools community. You will be hard-pressed to find a PaaS that natively supports every technology you wish to include into your most complex of applications. What is more important than a PaaS's core functionality alone how easily the service covers all of your needs with your choice of additional add-on partners. These partners and their technology extension should be able to be integrated with a few clicks.<br /> </li>
<li>Support. As with anything in the IT world, great technology is only half the battle. Having a team of knowledgable experts to help you grow your PaaS environment along with your business needs is essential. During your decision-making process, you should test support teams vigorously to ensure their response times and scope of support match the needs of your business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every organization can benefit from the power and ease of PaaS solutions, but not for every single part of their environment. Some things are great fits for PaaS and others are not. Stay tuned for future articles on what parts of your environment fit well in PaaS and which should stay in IaaS or dedicated environments.</p>
