<p>We currently do not have an official free plan anymore. However, if you had previously had aÂ free level account with us during the <a href="https://blog.appfog.com/changes-to-appfog-free-plans/">maintenance in February</a>, our <a href="mailto:billing@appfog.com">billing team</a> can downgrade you back to this. Please keep in mind that your resources will be drastically reduced from what they are with the paid plan.</p>
<p>If you upgraded before the maintenance in February, we cannot downgrade you to a free plan.</p>
