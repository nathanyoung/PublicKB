<p>AppFog has not been audited or certified for SafeHarbor, PCI, or SOC-2 compliance. AppFog v2 will be released early 2015 and meeting certain compliance certifications will become more essential to serve specific customer segments. However, CenturyLink Cloud (a.k.a., Tier 3, purchased by CenturyLink in Nov 2013) is Safe Harbor and SOC-2 certified - more details here: <a href="http://www.ctl.io/compliance">http://www.ctl.io/compliance</a>. Confirm current Safe Harbor status here: <a href="https://safeharbor.export.gov/swisslist.aspx">https://safeharbor.export.gov/swisslist.aspx</a>.</p>
<p>CenturyLink Cloud is not PCI DSS compliant. However, CenturyLink proper is listed on the VISA PCI Compliance Directory: <a href="http://www.visa.com/splisting/searchGrsp.do">http://www.visa.com/splisting/searchGrsp.do</a>.</p>
