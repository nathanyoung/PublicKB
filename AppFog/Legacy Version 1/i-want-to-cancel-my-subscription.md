<h4>Question:</h4>
<p>I have signed up for a plan, but I've decided to discontinue my service. How can I cancel my subscription?</p>
<h4>Solution:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Login to the <a href="https://console.appfog.com/login">Web Console</a>.</li>
<li>Navigate to your "ACCOUNT" page.</li>
<li>In the "Subscription Details" section, click the "Cancel Subscription" button.</li>
</ol>
<p>These steps will update your subscription status to <em>Cancelled</em>, which means it will not renew at the end of your current billing cycle.</p>
<p>After your subscription has ended, your account will remain open for 60 days, but will not have any resources available. You can reactivate your account any time before the window closes.</p>
<p><strong>Please be sure to download all source code, data, etc. because at the end of the 60 days, all content will be deleted.</strong> Our clean-up processes delete unused accounts, which includes all applications, services, environment variables, SSL certs, etc.</p>
