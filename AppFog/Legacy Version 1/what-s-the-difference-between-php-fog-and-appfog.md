<p><a href="https://phpfog.com">PHP Fog</a>, our original product, was a Platform-as-a-Service built specifically for PHP-based web apps. It ran on Amazon's AWS US-East data center and supported github integration, private VMs, and SSL.</p>
<p>PHP Fog was replaced by AppFog, which launched in the Summer of 2012, and PHP Fog was finally sunsetted in March of 2013. Read more about PHP Fog <a href="http://docs.phpfog.com">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://appfog.com">AppFog</a> is a polyglot, multi-cloud Platform-as-a-Service based on <a href="http://cloudfoundry.org/">the Cloud Foundry Open Source Project</a>. You can choose from <a href="http://docs.appfog.com/roadmap#langs">a growing list of languages and frameworks</a> and you can deploy from <a href="http://docs.appfog.com/roadmap#infras">a growing list of infrastructures and data centers</a> using our <a href="http://docs.appfog.com/getting-started/af-cli">command line tool</a>.</p>
