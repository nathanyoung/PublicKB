<h4>Problems:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cannot log into your account.</li>
<li>Cannot sign up for a new one (i.e., you see a 500 error page).</li>
<li>Had a free account as of April 2014.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Answer:</h4>
<p>Your account may have been deleted.</p>
<p>Many legacy free accounts were deleted during a push to remove inactive free users from our infrastructure in early May 2014. We sent out several emails in regards to this, but you can find some information about the process on <a href="https://blog.appfog.com/changes-to-appfog-free-plans/">our blog</a>. Since we didn't receive a reply about your account, it is now gone. We can free up your email address so that you may sign up for a new plan. We provide free 30-day trials for our customers that sign up for a Basic or Dev plan.</p>
<p><a href="mailto:support@appfog.com">Email customer support</a> and ensure you provide the account's email address, and we will assist.</p>
