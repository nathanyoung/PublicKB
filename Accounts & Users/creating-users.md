Users can be configured for both the Control Portal and the API.

### Control Portal Users

You can manage users on your account by going to the Control Portal &gt; Account &gt; Users.

NOTE: Permissions must be configured for a user after they are created in order to have access within the control. Learn more about [User Permissions](user-permissions.md).

1. Click the "Create New User" button
2. Fill in all required fields. The entered email address must be unique as it will also be the username.

4. Once a user is created an email will be sent to the email address supplied with the required information for logging in.

### API Users

You can manage users for version 1 of the API on your account by going to the Control Portal &gt; Account &gt; API.

1. Click on the "Create API User" button.
2. Enter an email address. The entered email address must be unique.

  NOTE: API users have full permission to account resources, and as such do not need permissions configured.

  NOTE: API v2 users control portal users rather than an API specific user.
